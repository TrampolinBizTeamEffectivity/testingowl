As you are talking about ".exe" I assume you are using Windows.

You can register a new extension and the corresponding program by using ftype and assoc:

Open a commandline window, and type the following:

    Register the new extension:

    assoc .bo2=GenaeDocument

    Associate the new type with a program:

    ftype GenaeDocument=javaw.exe -jar \path\to\your\program.jar "%1"

You will obviously need to adjust the path to your jar file. This also assumes javaw.exe can be found on the path. If that is not the case, just use the full path to javaw.exe.

After this, a doubleclick on a .bo2 file should start your application. I assumed you are using a Swing (GUI) application, therefor the ftype is using javaw.exe. If your application is a console program instead, you should use java.exe

(Note this can be done somehow through the ConrolPanel/Explorer as well, but I find it quicker and easier using the commandline)
